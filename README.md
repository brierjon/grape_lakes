INST 309 Independent Study - US Lakes Project

Project for independent study with Jonathan Brier @brierjon.

Plan of Action / Next Activities:
-- Build a query in Wikidata to find all US lakes
-- Each query should return a JSON - figure out how to look thru multiple results, and not just one result
-- Build text file or some data structure inside program
-- Recommended: dump query to text file so I donâ€™t have to continuously work with API
-- Start by looking at Infobox on wikipedia

Proposed Activity:
Do Wikipedia scanning to pull in missing facts to Wikidata for Lakes in the USA English
-- Start with survey of what is missing in Wikidata
-- Start with survey of what is present in Wikipedia English
    - Could expand scope to other languages as a stretch

Known issues:
-- Not all Wikidata items have all the fields outlined in the Wikidata Project
-- Not all Wikipedia pages have instance of lake

Resources:
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Lakes/Assessment
Wikidata ideal lake content that should be queryable: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Lakes

Example Wikidata Item: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4738340
Example Wikipedia Page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvord_Lake_(Arizona)
